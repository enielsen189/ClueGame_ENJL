0fe3a51 (HEAD -> master, origin/master) Cards in player hand now printed to gui
4279a8b All gui written, not showing player cards gui
783e454 Started gui to display seen cards
cb1a8c8 Added new classes
f399eaa Added File menu bar with functionality
fd3a313 Added DetectiveNotesGUI class
6903ed8 Board drawn with grid, names, and player starting locations
3859604 Board drawn with grid, labels, and door directions
31c6173 Added grid to board and created door direction switch
f132d8a Added ClueGame class and modified draw method
94906a3 Renamed GUI class to ControlPanelGUI and extended Board from JPanel
77850ae Changed loadBoardConfig and loadRoomConfig visibility back to public because CRaders tests depend on that
c95d479 Edited pickLocation from the ComputerPlayer class to include a boolean to determine whether or not both doorsInRange are included in visitedRooms
54b5df9 Changed the name of totalRooms to allLocations because the location a computer player could potentially end up at does not have to be a room, it could also be a walkway
1316bb4 Changed the visibility of doorsInRange and totalRooms in ComputerPlayer from public to private since they are not used outside of the class
87d1e5e Changed the name of resolution to solutionCheck in handleSuggestion() because resolution didn't make much sense as a variable name
d251187 Changed the following functions from public to private...calcAdjacencies(), findAllTargets(), loadWeaponConfig(), loadPlayerConfig(), loadBoardConfig(), loadRoomConfig(), and convertColor()
d95f509 Renamed x and y to column and row respectively in calcAdjacencies() in order to have it make more sense
d13fa84 Renamed 'C1' to 'tempComputer' in the loadPlayerConfig() function because it didn't make sense to make a C1 every time and add it to the arraylist. They will not all be C1
df08b56 for loadBoardConfig(), the Scanner in was never being closed, so I added the in.close() statement after the while loop
113bdcb Added the methods in loadConfigFiles into initialize function to reduce function hopping
7eb1834 Added comments explaining the different config files because we seem to have so many of them
79070a3 New Repository with code
